## WELCOME TO DREAMLAND

This document is a collection of notes and how-to's for generative, 'artistic' usages of Neural Networks including a sister Github repository with some [example code](https://github.com/stephenmmcleod/deepdreem). It is organized into loose sections, and will be updated infrequently. Please enjoy, and feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to contribute to the document!
